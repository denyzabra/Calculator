# Simple Calculator - Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Simple Calculator project! This project is an open-source effort to create a web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If you'd like to contribute and add functionality to the calculator, this guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
 Open the calculator.html file in your code editor.
Adding Functionality
The main functionality of this calculator is currently missing. To add the calculator's logic, follow these steps:

 Inside the calculator.html file, locate the <script> tag within the <head> section.

Write JavaScript code to implement the calculator's functionality. You can use the HTML element IDs provided in the HTML code to access and manipulate input
values and display the results. Here's an example of how to add a simple addition operation:

You can follow a similar approach to implement subtraction, multiplication, and division functionality by creating event listeners for the respective buttons.

Test your changes by opening the calculator.html file in a web browser and using the calculator.

Ensure your code follows best practices and is well-documented to make it easy for other contributors to understand and review your work.
